    "body": "Beijing has called on Japan to pursue \"peaceful development\" under its new defence minister appointed this week after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election.\n\nMr Abe on Wednesday appointed Gen Nakatani, 57 to replace Akinori Eto to the defence portfolio after Mr Eto declined reappointment in the midst of a political funding scandal.\n\nMr Nakatani headed the defence agency -- later upgraded to a ministry -- in 2001-2002 and is said to agree with Mr Abe on the need for Japan to beef up its national security.\n\n\"It is our position that whoever serves as the defence minister of Japan, the Japanese side should follow the path of peaceful development,\" defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun, a senior colonel, told a monthly briefing.\n\nMr Yang also called on Japan to implement an agreement reached in November between the two countries aimed at improving ties which have become increasingly strained in recent years.\n\nThe four-point agreement paved the way for the first formal bilateral meeting between Mr Abe and President Xi Jinping last month on the sidelines of the APEC Asia-Pacific leaders' meeting in Beijing."
